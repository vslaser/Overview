# Overview
The repositories showcase my data science projects. I have chosen a few of my scripts to protray the key aspects that would be of interest and projects that allow me to experiment with various concepts of data science

# Natural Language Processing
This project is a word predictor using natural language processing involving data gathering from news, blogs and twitter, data transformation and modelling.

# Machine Learning - Accelerometers Data
In this project, the goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which the subjects did weightlifting exercise. The participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. This report describes how I built my model, how I used cross validation, the expected out of sample error, and why I made the choices I did. The report also uses the  prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

# FIFA World Cup Predictor
This was a fun exercise to predict the winner of the FIFA world cup. I did this project to participate in an office internal bet which I ended up winning despite minimal kmnowledge of the game.
